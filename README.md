*   **Markdown Parsing:** Marked.js.

## Prerequisites (for Development)

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm). It's recommended to use a recent LTS version.
*   A Google Gemini API Key. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

## Setup and Installation (for Development)

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the source code):**
    ```bash
    # If using Git
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd day-planner 
    # Or simply navigate to the project directory if you downloaded the source
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Open a terminal in the project root directory (`day-planner`) and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure API Key:**
    *   **Option 1 (Recommended for Development):** Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory (`day-planner/`). Add your Gemini API key to this file:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    *   **Option 2 (In-App Settings):** Alternatively, you can run the app once and set the API key via the "Settings" view within the application. The app will prioritize the key set in the Settings view.

## Running the Application (for Development)

To run the application in development mode:
```bash
npm start
```
This will launch the Electron application window.

## Building the Application (for Distribution)

To build distributable packages (currently configured for Linux `.deb`):
```bash
npm run dist
```
The packaged application will be found in the `dist/` directory. For example, `dist/day-planner_1.0.0_amd64.deb`.

You can install the `.deb` package on Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu) using:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i dist/day-planner_1.0.0_amd64.deb
# If there are dependency issues, run:
sudo apt-get install -f
```
